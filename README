This is the repository for a python program that searches for all song lyrics by an inputted artist.

AT THE TIME OF WRITING, THE 'lyricsovh' API IS UNAVAILABLE, THUS A MESSIER APPROACH HAD TO BE TAKEN (and the lyricsgenius api felt like cheating)

The program runs in python 2.7, and the following modules are required:
musicbrainzngs, sys, requests, bs4, re, numpy, matplotlib

To run the program, install necessary pre-requisites, copy repository over to your working directory and run the main.py code in the command line.
